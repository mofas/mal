Dear mofa,

Thank you for signing up for First-Year Composition 2.0! We're excited to introduce you to
college-level composition in some of its many forms. 

In this course, you'll have the opportunity to create and design written, visual,
and oral projects and to get valuable feedback from your fellow students about your work.
With helpful instruction from me and from other teachers in Georgia Tech's School of Literature,
Media, and Communication, you will learn more about communication processes and become more confident
in using communication strategies. Together, we'll work on planning, drafting, revising, and
publishing written, visual, and oral communication. 

Because we have already begun working as a communication community, you may find fewer learners with
whom you can engage in peer-review. Since peer-review is the central form of evaluation in this
course, you may find it more difficult to have your work fully evaluated. 
We look forward to our time together working on these projects. 

Sincerely, 

Dr. Karen Head and the First-Year Comp 2.0 Team
